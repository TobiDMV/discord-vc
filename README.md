# Discord-vc

Discord-vc is a wrapper of the @discord/voice library. The intended purpose is to make it easier for people who are new to working with Discord Voice Chat features in node.js.

CREDITS to @discord/voice for giving me the inspiration to create this, and using their examples to learn more about this!
